# Lovit Library Documentation

Welcome to the Lovit Library documentation site! This site provides a comprehensive guide to using the Lovit library, including API details, usage examples, and more.

The main tools used to build this site are:

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling, enabling fast and responsive design.
- **[Vite](https://vite.dev)**: A next-generation, fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **[React](https://react.dev)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com)** â€“ Markdown + JSX for writing documentation with React components.

Together, these tools enable us to build a scalable, performant, and highly flexible documentation site

## Running the Site Locally

To start the documentation site in development mode, run:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

This will launch the site using Vite on a local development server (usually at http://localhost:5173).
