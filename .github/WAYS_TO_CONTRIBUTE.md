## How to Find Something to Contribute

Want to help out but not sure where to start? Here are different ways to find valuable opportunities to contribute — whether it's improving code, fixing bugs, testing features, or enhancing the documentation site.

### 1. Review the Documentation  
- Look for typos, outdated content, or broken links  
- Improve unclear explanations or missing sections  
- Add code examples, guides, or tutorials  
- Suggest improvements to layout, navigation, or readability  

Good documentation helps everyone — even small tweaks matter!


### 2. Explore the Source Code  
- Identify code that can be simplified, cleaned up, or refactored  
- Look for missing types or unnecessary complexity  
- Improve naming, structure, or documentation comments  
- Check for consistency with coding standards and formatting  

Small improvements to code quality are always appreciated.


### 3. Test the Library in Real-World Scenarios  
- Use the library in actual projects or test environments  
- Try uncommon combinations or edge cases  
- Report any bugs, confusing APIs, or unexpected behavior  
- Suggest improvements to make using the library easier

Testing the library yourself helps find hidden problems.


### 4. Check for Missing Tests  
- Look for untested logic or edge cases  
- Add tests for tricky or newly added features  
- Improve test structure, readability, or coverage reports  

Well-tested code is easier to trust and maintain.


### 5. Test Responsiveness and Cross-Browser Support  
- Check the docs site on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)  
- Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
- Look for layout issues, overflow bugs, or accessibility problems  
- Verify mobile navigation, and responsive behavior  

Responsive UI leads to better user experience.

### 6. Improve Accessibility (a11y)  
- Ensure the site works with keyboard navigation  
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where needed  
- Verify color contrast and focus visibility  
- Report anything that blocks screen reader usage  

Accessibility makes the project usable for everyone.


### 7. Suggest New Features or Enhancements  
- Think of features that could improve usability or performance  
- Identify missing configuration options or integrations  
- Open an issue or discussion to share your idea  

Even if you don’t want to build it yourself, sharing ideas helps!

### 10. Optimize Performance  
- Profile build time, runtime behavior, or rendering speed  
- Look for unnecessary re-renders or heavy operations  
- Suggest caching, memoization, or lazy loading where needed  
- Identify slow or inefficient logic  

Performance tuning is often overlooked but extremely impactful.


### 11. Update and Audit Dependencies  
- Check for outdated, deprecated, or vulnerable packages  
- Suggest replacing heavy or unused dependencies  
- Review the package size or tree-shaking issues (for the library)  

Keeping dependencies healthy improves stability and security.

These are just a few ideas to get you started, but there’s always more you can do — think about it! Every contribution counts, whether it’s writing code, fixing typos, improving tests, or sharing new ideas. Thanks for helping make the project better!
